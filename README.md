# CreditCardFraudDetection
This is a dataset acquired from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). In this project, a Logistic Regression model is trained to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. I have used StandardScaler to preprocess data and used an F1 score and AUC score metric since the data was heavily imbalanced.
